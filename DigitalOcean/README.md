## Introduction

When viewing a webpage in a browser, you're making a request to another computer on the internet.

That computer provides you the webpage as a response.

The computer -> web server

A web server recieves HTTP requests from a client (like a browser), and provides a HTTP response, like an HTML page or JSON from an API.

Front-end code -> concerned with how content is presented,

Back-end code -> concerned how data is exchanged, collected, processed and stored.
Handling network requests/communicating with a database are examples of tasks handled by back-end code.

## Returning Different Types of Content

Webservers seldom return plain text. JSON/HTML common, but also non-text formats like PDF's, videos or audio.
